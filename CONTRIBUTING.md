   ```

2. **Make your changes** in logical commits
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly
4. **Add or update tests** as necessary
5. **Update documentation** if needed

### Commit Messages

## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Style Guide

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use strict TypeScript configuration

### Code Structure

- Follow the existing architecture pattern (Domain-Driven Design)
- Place business logic in the Domain layer
- Keep infrastructure concerns separate
- Use dependency injection where appropriate

### File Organization

- Use kebab-case for file names
- Group related files in directories
- Keep files focused on a single responsibility
- Use index.ts files for clean exports

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both happy paths and error cases

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('FeatureName', () => {
  describe('when condition', () => {
    it('should do something', () => {
      // Arrange
      const input = {};

      // Act
      const result = doSomething(input);

      // Assert
      expect(result).toBe(expected);
    });
  });
});
```
